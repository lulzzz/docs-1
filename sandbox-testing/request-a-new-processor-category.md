If your device is not listed here, please fell free to make a request for the development of a new device category and message processor extension.

It would be helpful if you can send us  a .txt file of the message that is received from the Health IoT Edge TCP listener. You can copy the logs to a notepad .txt file and send it to us. Please refer to the following link to learn how to read the logs:
